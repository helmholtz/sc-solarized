# sc-solarized

An implementation of Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized] (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) themes for the Supercollider IDE.

## Installation

Simply replace your `sc_ide_conf.yaml` file (on OS X, this lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Supercollider`) with either `solarized-dark.yaml` or `solarized-light.yaml`. If you'd rather not lose your other settings (window geometry, recent files), you can simply copy-paste the relevant portions.

## TODO

-Apply to scdoc css file
-Further color tweaking
